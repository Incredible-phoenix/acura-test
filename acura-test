About
A Web & Blockchain engineer with 9 years of experience in software technology, Fintech, telecommunications, and government policy.
The advantage of working with me is my passion and complete dedication to the web development industry. I have a wide range of technical and tactical skills that allow me to build and design advanced web solutions. My extensive training in agile methodologies and lead development makes me a beneficial team member.
Strong Object-Oriented Programming, implementation of Web Applications, database design and SQL querying are what I'm concerned about and what I focused on. So far I have Solidity, Web3, EthJS, Javascript, Python, Ruby, C#, PHP under my belt and gained profound knowledge in Agile/Scrum, Git/GitLab/BitBucket, Trello/Jira/Asana, React/Angular/Node, and other technologies like Django and Ruby on Rails.
I mainly focused on front end UI/UX implementation with Next.js, React, Gatsby, and for the back end, complicated business logic implementation with Node.js, PHP, Ruby on Rails.
Recently, I have worked with a wide range of companies in multiple verticals to include; Healthcare, Logistics, Real Estate, Fintech/DeFi, and Blockchain/Crypto. I am thorough with requirements and care about your business and project, and will architect the best solution keeping security and scalability in mind to ensure there is no technical debt.
Some of my other passions are being innovative, being an entrepreneur, investing, and sharing what I’ve learned. I believe in pushing ourselves past our comfort zone and doing what others deem impossible. I always bring this to the table whether it’s in my personal life, being apart of a team, or working for a company. If we collaborate together you can expect the impossible to become possible.
Wishing everyone well and safety during COVID-19.
